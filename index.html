    <h3>The Movie</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6;">The movie will begin in five moments. <br>The mindless voice announced all those unseated will await the next
        show.<br> We filed slowly, languidly into the hall.<br>
        The auditorium was vast and silent as we were seated and were darkened, the voice continued. <br>The program for
        this evening is not new. <br>Youâ€™ve seen this entertainment through and through. <br>Youâ€™ve seen your birth your
        life and death you might recall all of the rest.
    </p>

    <h3>The Waiting</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6;">Gently they stir, gently rise. <br>The dead are newborn awakening. <br>With ravaged limbs and wet souls. <br>Gently they sigh
        in rapt funeral amazement. <br>Who called these dead to dance?

        <br>Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand? <br>Was it the wilderness children? <br>Was it
        the ghost god himself, stuttering, cheering, chatting blindly?
        <br>I called you up to anoint the earth. <br>I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin. <br>I called you to
        wish you well. <br>To glory in self like a new monster. <br>And now I call you to pray.
